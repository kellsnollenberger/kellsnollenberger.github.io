          <p class="lead section-lead">
            POPS is owned by Kells Nollenberger and Ryan Tsang. They met as
            musicians and built this venue around what artists and audiences
            need from a room: respect, clarity, and consistency. Kells brings
            operational experience from running a successful hospitality
            business, plus years of live performance across multiple genres.
            Together, they are building a place that treats musicians as
            collaborators and neighbors as regulars.

          operations, and a welcoming room that supports local culture without
          shutting people out.
